# An Ansible module to talk with OVH API

## Requirements

Tested with:

- Python 3.7
- [Python-ovh 0.5](https://github.com/ovh/python-ovh)
- Ansible 2.9+

## Collection

This module can be [installed as a collection](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html#installing-a-collection-from-a-git-repository)

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/synthesio/infra-ovh-ansible-module
```

This collection provides the following modules:

```text
dedicated_server_boot
dedicated_server_display_name
dedicated_server_info
dedicated_server_install
dedicated_server_install_wait
dedicated_server_monitoring
dedicated_server_networkinterfacecontroller
dedicated_server_terminate
dedicated_server_vrack
domain
installation_template
ip_reverse
public_cloud_block_storage_instance
public_cloud_block_storage
public_cloud_failover_ip_info
public_cloud_flavorid_info
public_cloud_imageid_info
public_cloud_instance
public_cloud_instance_failover_ip
public_cloud_instance_info
public_cloud_instance_info_by_name
public_cloud_instance_vrack
public_cloud_monthly_billing
public_cloud_project_info
```

You can read the documentation of every modules with `ansible-doc synthesio.ovh.$modules`

An example for a custom template to install a dedicated server is present in `roles/ovhtemplate` folder

## Upgrade from synthesio.ovh < 5.0.0

Before version 5.0.0 of the collection, all tasks were in the same `synthesio.ovh.ovh` module !
Since 5.0.0, the collection has been rewritten: it is now split into multiple modules, which is easier to maintain, enhance, debug,
and more ansible collection compliant.

If you are upgrading from 4.0.0 and earlier, please read the doc and update your playbooks !

## Configuration

The collection path must be defined in your `ansible.cfg` :

```ini
[defaults]
collections_paths = collections/
```

In `/etc/ovh.conf`:

```ini
[default]
; general configuration: default endpoint
endpoint=ovh-eu

[ovh-eu]
; configuration specific to 'ovh-eu' endpoint
application_key=<YOUR APPLICATION KEY>
application_secret=<YOUR APPLICATIOM SECRET>
consumer_key=<YOUR CONSUMER KEY>
```

Alternatively, you can provide credentials as module attributes:

```yaml
- name: Add server to vrack
  synthesio.ovh.dedicated_server_vrack:
    endpoint: "ovh-eu"
    application_key: "<YOUR APPLICATION KEY>"
    application_secret: "<YOUR APPLICATIOM SECRET>"
    consumer_key: "<YOUR CONSUMER KEY>"
    vrack: "{{ vrackid }}"
    service_name: "{{ ovhname }}"
```

This allows you to store them in Ansible vault or to use any lookup plugin to retrieve them.

## Usage

Here are a few examples of what you can do. Please read the module for everything else, it most probably does it!

As this is a collection now you must declare it in each task.

A few examples:

### Add a host into the vrack

```yaml
- name: Add server to vrack
  synthesio.ovh.dedicated_server_vrack:
    service_name: "{{ ovhname }}"
    vrack: "{{ vrackid }}"
```

### Add a DNS entry for `internal.bar.example.com`

```yaml
- name: Add server IP to DNS
  synthesio.ovh.domain:
    domain: "example.com"
    value: "192.0.2.1"
    record_type: "A"
    name: "internal.bar"

```

### Install a new dedicated server

```yaml
- Install new dedicated server
  synthesio.ovh.dedicated_server_install:
    service_name: "ns12345.ip-1-2-3.eu"
    hostname: "server01.example.net"
    template: "debian10_64"

- name: Wait for the server installation
  synthesio.ovh.dedicated_server_install_wait:
    service_name: "ns12345.ip-1-2-3.eu"
    max_retry: "240"
    sleep: "10"
```

### Install a new dedicated server with only 2 disks

```yaml
- Install new dedicated server
  synthesio.ovh.dedicated_server_install:
    service_name: "ns12345.ip-1-2-3.eu"
    hostname: "server01.example.net"
    template: "debian10_64"
    soft_raid_devices: "2"

```

### Install a public cloud instance

```yaml
- name: run a public cloud installation
  synthesio.ovh.public_cloud_instance:
    name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    ssh_key_id: "{{ ssh_key_id }}"
    service_name: "{{ service_name }}"
    networks: "{{ networks }}"
    flavor_id: "{{ flavor_id }}"
    region: "{{ region }}"
    image_id: "{{ image_id }}"
```
